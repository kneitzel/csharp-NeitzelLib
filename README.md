# NeitzelLib

This is a small library which I used when I was developing c# code. Not sure if it is really useful for anyone.

I also used it to show how some things might be done inside the MSDN forums. It was hosted 
on coedeplex in the past but after codeplex was shut down I simply moved it here.

I am no longer active inside the MSDN forums but if you have any questions then feel free to leave me a note here.
