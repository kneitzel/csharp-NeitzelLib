MyIrc Concepts
==============

In this documents I am just writing down some notes why I did something
in the way I actually did it.


1. Neitzel.MyIrc.Lib
====================

1.1. Use of Delegates / Events
The IRCMessageEvaluator is calling an Event for each Message that I
receive. That way the Client can simply add his routines wherever needed.
So for example it could also be possible that a script adds itself there,
too. So the idea is to give these basics directly in the lib so that the
different Clients can do all on their own at that point.
